.TH PUMP 1 "13 November 2016" "2.1.0-alpha.0"
.SH NAME
pump.io \- stream server that does most of what people really want from a
social network
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pump
[ --config
.IR config_path
| -c
.IR config_path
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
I post something and my followers see it. That's the rough idea behind
the pump.

There's an API defined in the
.B API.md
file in the source. It uses activitystrea.ms JSON as the main data and
command format.

You can post almost anything that can be represented with activity
streams -- short or long text, bookmarks, images, video, audio,
events, geo checkins. You can follow friends, create lists of people,
and so on.

The software is useful for at least these scenarios:

* Mobile-first social networking

* Activity stream functionality for an existing app

* Experimenting with social software

It also comes with a web UI.
